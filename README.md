# Abstract

Predicting the survival criteria of a colorectal cancer patient after diagnosis
and chemotherapy session(s). A decision tree classifier predicts recurrence or
death based on various influencing factors after estimating Information gain
and Gini index values. This can benefit the patient and the doctor for taking
decisions regarding further treatment and to avoid unnecessary actions. Unlike
the normal process of prevention of cancer and risk prediction, this is a post
cancer aid for decision making. Four primary models, CART, RPART, KNN and LDA
are tested with CART generating maximum accuracy.
